# Risk
All of the tools that any great Risk general needs for global domination!

## Risk Simulator
The Risk simulator is my patented (not really) simulator for determining your odds of success in Risk. After many heartbreaking defeats I decided that I needed to make more informed decisions for my armies and so now I can enter the number of attacking and defending troops and my all powerful simulator will tell me the odds of my victory and how many troops I should expect to sacrifice.

## Risk Probability
I was curious the odds of winning when attacking and defending with different amounts of die in Risk. Obviously attacking 3 on 1 is a solid bet, but some of the others weren't as obvious so instead of racking my brain at probability I wrote a script to just test it out for me.
